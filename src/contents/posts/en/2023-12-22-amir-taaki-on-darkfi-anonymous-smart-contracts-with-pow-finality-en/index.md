Amir Taaki, a British-Iranian technologist and visionary, has left an indelible mark on the landscape of cryptocurrency and open-source technology. As an anarchist and software developer Amir has been a believer in Bitcoin since 2010, launching Britain’s first ever Bitcoin exchange.

Amir's commitment to open-source principles and his advocacy for decentralized systems have earned him recognition as a trailblazer in the cryptocurrency space.  Recently, he’s led the Dark Wallet project, which seeks to build a fully anonymous, browser-based Bitcoin app to enhance the currency’s ability to evade corporate and government control.
 
Amir introduces his latest project -- DarkFi -- a new democratic economic experiment and operating system for society.
