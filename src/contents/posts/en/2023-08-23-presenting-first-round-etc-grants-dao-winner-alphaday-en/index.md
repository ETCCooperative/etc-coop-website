We are happy to present [Alphaday](https://etcgrants.softr.app/project-details-en?recordId=recFXsxD1gSPBC6ab) as one of the winners of the first round of the ETC Grants DAO program!

Below please find our email interview with Deniz Omer, who is the founder of Alphaday:

Donald McIntyre (DM): Can you describe the team please?  
  
Deniz Omer (DO): We are all Ethereum enthusiasts who’ve been part of the space since before theDAO hack. We’re a remote team from Cyprus, France, Chile, Nigeria and Spain and we’re super-passionate about building and using Web3 products.
  
DM: Can you describe the project please?  
  
DO: Alphaday is a powerful web3 experience aggregator that allows a user to carry out their entire daily crypto workflow from one beautiful and powerful UI. Today, news, media and on-chain and off-chain data is spread across a vast number of siloed sources and staying up to date with a project/community/ecosystem involves constantly jumping from one tab to another. Alphaday brings all these into one experience so users can track their assets, use their favourite dapps, listen to podcasts, research new narratives and do so much more from one interface. This saves significant time for users while keeping them more informed of the crypto world around them.  
  
DM: How much money did you receive from the ETC Grants DAO?  

DO: We received a grant of $3,800.  
  
DM: Why did you choose ETC?  
  
DO: Ethereum Classic is a valuable incubator of web3 ideas and concepts and as the leading proof-of-work smart contract platform, it has an important role to play in the future growth of our space. So for us, building a dashboard for the ETC Community was a no brainer. Plus, over the years we’ve met so many awesome people involved with ETC that this was a good opportunity for us to get to work with them.
