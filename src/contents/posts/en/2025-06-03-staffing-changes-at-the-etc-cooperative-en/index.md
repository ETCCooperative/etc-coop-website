Today we are announcing some staffing changes at the ETC Cooperative.

Our Marketing Manager, Andrew Dick, will be stepping down from his role at the ETC Cooperative as of June 15 2025.

Andrew has worked for the Coop since November of 2022 and in these 30 months he has done an excellent job planning, directing, and implementing our marketing, communications, and social media efforts.

During the same period, Andrew has been a key figure in the planning and implementation of both the 2023 and 2024 POW Summits; he managed the migration of the ETC Cooperative’s website; and handled communications of the ETC Grants Program.

Andrew is a great professional, we wish him success in his future endeavors, and will be missed.

To partially assume Andrew’s functions and lead other related activities, we are happy to announce the hiring of Donald McIntyre as Ecosystem Relations Manager.

Donald has served as Senior Editor at the ETC Cooperative from November of 2022 to December of 2024. His new role will have the goal of managing all external relations of the ETC Cooperative with regard to the ETC ecosystem. 

These tasks will include communicating to the ETC ecosystem the periodic announcements of the ETC Cooperative; maintaining and fostering relations with ecosystem constituents, such as exchanges, miners, mining pools, wallet operators, end point providers, node operators, dapp developers, and other participants; and maintaining and fostering relations with media outlets, bloggers, vloggers, and other influencers in the industry.

Additionally, the Ecosystem Relations manager will maintain and foster relations with donors to the ETC Cooperative, and through various channels explain to investors, users, developers, and other interested parties the features and benefits of ETC.

Donald will be starting his new responsibility at the ETC Cooperative on June 2 2025.
