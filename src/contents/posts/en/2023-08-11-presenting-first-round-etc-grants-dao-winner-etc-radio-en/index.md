### This Is the Transcript of the Interview

Donald McIntyre (DM): Hi I'm Donald McIntyre senior editor at the ETC Cooperative, today we're going to talk about the ETC Grants DAO winners and we are going to interview Corey of ETC Radio, hello Corey, how are you?

Corey ( C ): Good! How are you doing Donald? Donald is one of my favorite people in ETC, by the way, so...

DM: Very well thank you! Bueno, I see that we have amazing backgrounds. That we found here on Zoom. Very ETC backgrounds!

C: Right and the green shirts. I wore the green shirt on purpose. 

DM: And the green shirts! Yeah, yeah it's the perfect interview. Bueno, Corey, you are one of the winners, or ETC Radio is one of the winners of the ETC Grants DAO, so congratulations for that. And, I have a few questions for you. The first one is to describe your team.

C: Great question because it's actually evolved over time. So, 15 months ago I hosted the first ETC Radio and it wasn't even called ETC Radio at the time. I think I called it like ETC Chat for some giveaways, I was involved with a bunch of different NFT projects. So, the team was actually myself and my a guy named Michael.ETC at the time co-hosted it. And, then he rolled off a few months later. When you say my team I have to talk about the ETC Community first of all. I've gotten Graphics made by so many community members! And, so when I say team it's not just me it's the whole community. I mean I got graphics from, Perioso, Tricky.Mick, Xenos... I mean, I can name 30 or 40 people that have helped out, honestly, with ETC Radio since it started so the team will evolve over time but I've been the main, kind of consistent player in ETC Radio since day one, is the way to describe it.

DM: I would say. If you've been doing it for 15 months that's very consistent! Especially during this crypto winter.

C: That's right.

DM: Bueno, tell me what is the project. What is ETC radio?

C: Yeah, so the main goal of ETC radio, honestly, is to help with crypto adoption, ETC adoption is the main focus, but when you ask what the project really is, it is the mouthpiece for anything related to Ethereum Classic. We have dozens of projects on every Friday. These are project leads, projects that haven't come out, community members, just fans of of proof of work, and etc. in general. But I would say the main project's goal is adoption of ETC. Get the word out, education, we talk about crypto safety, we talk about news and chat of what's going on in the ecosystem of ETC. I know you're on there a lot as well and the topics can go any direction. Sometimes you talk about life, so, but I think the number one goal is to get the word out, and get adoption to the ETC ecosystem... that's the number one goal of it.

DM: Yes, I have attended the show several times and I like the format. It's like very relaxed and open. It's like a conversation format, right? Because I hear or I think of ETC radio, and when I think of a radio it's usually a one-way speaker to everybody. But in this case the format is very open isn't it?

C: Yeah, I mean I've only had to remove somebody maybe once or twice because they were asking for money. But it's an open forum for anybody. I let anybody get the stage for Q&A. I have a lot of people that come in new to ask about, you know, what is Ethereum Classic. But the format, you know, I love to start with a few songs, give an update on the crypto market, give an update on ETC projects, but you're right it's very informal. To me, crypto should be fun. Yeah, it's serious, but it's fun at the same time. If you hear, you know, I'm always trying to joke on there, tell stories. I have a huge investment background, so I talk about a little bit of everything, but the goal is to be informal, have the floor to anybody and any project is allowed to come on there. Most projects involved at ETC do come on there to speak, give updates on their project, they might talk about what they're trying to do. They might ask for help. They do a giveaway. So, there's a lot of different things going on.

DM: You do it every Friday, but do you have a fixed time that you do it every Friday, or you announce it a few days earlier? 

C: So, I rotate it. It's been pretty consistent between either noon eastern or five eastern. So, I've played around with it. Those are the two windows that I feel like have the best engagement and tune-ins before and after, so I actually keep with those two times to rotate it for different time zones as well. We have guys on there from the UK, Europe, Canada, all over the U.S, so I deal with like three or four time zones to try to plug people in. 

DM: I love that, and I love to listen to the different accents of people who speak. So, just for the audience to know, you can tune in to ETC Radio on Twitter spaces on Fridays. It's ETC underscore Radio (ETC_RADIO) that's the handle, and you can participate, you can listen to the show, and you can also ask questions, and talk about ETC, etc. And you can even ask questions to other people in the audience. 

C: So, anybody's on the floor, anybody can be on the hot seat by the way. 

DM: Yeah! Many, many times I end up speaking. That's right. The other question that I have is, how much did you apply for and how much did you get for the grants?

C:  Yeah, yeah, so I did a pretty, a fairly detailed submission to the grants. I put there each quarter, what the breakdown of the funds will go to, and how it's going to be used. So, I requested the $10K, a community Grant. I don't think there's any other device or mouthpiece of the ETC community that has as much engagement as ETC Radio so far. But, the breakdown is $2,500 per quarter. Around there. It'll be several different payments. I'm going to use this for the cost of the ETC Radio, but a lot of it is going to be out. I want to produce merchandise to be for giveaways. I will attend conferences where I'll also be giving away different items. It could be a shirt or a hat. Even we give away a lot of NFTs. So, my goal from day one is pretty much a non-profit and everything that I generate, and a lot of stuff is donated by the way, so all the different projects will donate to it. But, this grant money, I wanna, it's gonna enable me to do more education. I might even host more than once a week now, based on time. Maybe get a few interns to produce and help as well. There's a lot of stuff this will go to.

DM: Excellent. That's amazing. And, when I see that we share a passion, a passion for ETC. So, so the last question is, I have a fifth question, but this is the fourth question: Why did you choose ETC? Why do you have such passion for ETC? And, you think that ETC Radio, you want to do it dedicated to ETC?

C: It's a great, great question. I could spend 20 minutes talking about this, but I'll try to do 30 seconds. I can't do anything in five minutes, by the way! So, the reality is Ethereum Classic, what drew me to it, originally I was doing a lot of stuff on Ethereum, Cardano, Bitcoin, but what kept drawing me back to Ethereum Classic was the strong community and the lower gas fees, but when you look at the the background, Ethereum Classic has everything. It's like Bitcoin and Ethereum combined and, by the way, Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum. FYI. I want to make a t-shirt that says this on it! But, the factors that drove me and keep me here: decentralized, permissionless, limited supply of 210 million. Guess what, Ethereum has no cap on supply, people don't know that, right? You know, a lot of smart contracts, the strong community, the NFTs, I mean there's a million things I can mention. And, I think the reality is there's very few strong proof of work chains left. Especially after Ethereum went to the merge to proof of stake. Yeah, most of my time now, a majority is spent on Ethereum Classic as well as Bitcoin. Those are the two areas I spend the most time on. I'm not doing as much on all the different blockchains that are proof of stake anymore. So those are a couple, couple quick reasons. 

DM: Good, good. I think Bitcoin and ETC are the two blockchains of the future, and Bitcoin is the largest proof of work one. Bueno, we know what is Bitcoin, but it's only accounts and balances, and Ethereum Classic is the same but you add programmability. So, it is of incredible value and ETC is the largest proof of work smart contracts blockchain in the world right now, and it's very likely, there's no reason... 

C: By the way Donald, that Ethereum should have a 90x market cap to Ethereum Classic, I think that Gap is going to close over time. 

DM: Yeah, yeah, I agree, I agree. Bueno, speaking of that, my last question that occurred to me while you were speaking is that you said that you have a strong investment background, what is that background?

C: Yeah, so I've spent the past 20 plus years in the institutional investment consulting world. So, very large pension funds, 401k's, third party for high net worth shops. I've done everything in the investment realm. Every asset class. I was trading stocks in college so I've always been in that realm and I got heavy in crypto probably three and a half years ago. Actually, I invested in a lot of projects, I researched a lot of projects, and you know when I say investment background like, guys that you see on CNBC, I know most of those guys. Part of my job is to interview and drill those those guys with questions. So, I get a lot of questions about, you know, how are you a good interviewer? and, how do you keep the conversation going? I've done thousands and thousands of investment meetings in my career, so I'm used to asking the hard questions. I'm used to keeping the conversation going because that's pretty much what my day job is. I'm the middleman between the end client and the guys that actually run the money, who are the asset managers. So, that's kind of a quick background on what I do. 

Also, I wanted to share really quickly...the past two months ETC Radio has had 35,000 Impressions on Twitter. Just to give you data! We average anywhere from 100 to 250 actual tune-ins. Most of those are replays later on. It's increased every month over the past 15 months. The top three ETC Radios, I gotta say, the interview with with Donald, the interview with Bob Summerwill, the first time interview with patient money. Those three ETC Radios alone, the impressions on those I think it was about 15 to 20K impressions. Just under three episodes. 

DM: That's amazing. You're doing great work, and I think you totally deserve the grant, and it's totally justified, and I think it's going to be very productive. I'm sure that in a few month you should apply for, because you can apply for this for the future rounds as well. If you have more projects, or not projects, but things to fund for ETC Radio, if that is possible, and I think you're doing a great job for ETC. So, thank you so much for that. 

C: Thank you so much, I want to say thank you to the super strong ETC community. I'm here for them before anybody else, so I just want to mention that.

DM: The difference between the Ethereum community, Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, and all those. And, ETC and Bitcoin, I would say are very similar, is that we believe in the principles, and we believe in the philosophy, and everything else is downstream of that. Like Istora said. And. that is very different than being there because it's cool, the community is cool, and "oh I like the Innovation" and "I just want to compete intellectually" or "I just want the coin to go up" and things like that. For us all of that is secondary and this is why ETC is such a passionate community.

C: We're passionate, we're serious, we're here for the long term. Most people aren't, in crypto in general. 

DM: Yeah. Bueno, thank you so much Corey! Congratulations for earning the grant.

C:  Thank you Donald!

DM: Goodbye.
