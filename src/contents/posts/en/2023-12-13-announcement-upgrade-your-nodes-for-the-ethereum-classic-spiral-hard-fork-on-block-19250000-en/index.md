## ATTENTION ETHEREUM CLASSIC NODE OPERATORS AND MINERS:

The [Ethereum Classic upgrade](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2023-12-09-spiral-fork-announcement), code named SPIRAL, will occur on block 19,250,000. The estimated date for SPIRAL is January 31 2024.

Ethereum Classic core developers have posted  [ECIP-1109](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1109), which provides information for ETC’s SPIRAL hard fork.

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Ethereum Classic networks:

`9_957_000`  on Mordor testnet (already upgraded in November of 2023)

`19_250_000`  on Ethereum Classic mainnet (estimated for January 31 2024)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the  _Specification_  section of this document.

## Technical Details, Motivation, and Rationale

For technical details, motivation, and rationale for the hard fork, please visit ECIP-1109:  [http://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1109](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1109)

## Node Explorer

Adoption across publicly visible ETC nodes can be tracked on this dashboard by looking at the percentage of nodes for which ForkId (Next) = Spiral:

## Client supporting the SPIRAL hard-fork

The following client release contains SPIRAL support. All node operators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

– Core-geth  [v1.12.17](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/releases/tag/v1.12.17)  or later.

## Communications

If you are using a managed API service or third-party service provider, then please ensure they are ready for SPIRAL.

The more people who ask, the more likely a provider is to make a public statement confirming their readiness.

If you are a miner, mining pool, node operator, wallet operator or other kind of ETC stakeholder, please upgrade your node/s to minimize the risk of network splits.
