In our video interview, we spoke with Griff Green, founder of Giveth, about the following topics:

- Giveth team description
- What is the Giveth project?
- Grant amount earned
- Why did they choose Ethereum Classic to do this Giveth implementation?
- Bonus: What was Griff Green's role in 2016 when ETH and ETC split?

Among the highlights of the interview we touched on what is the GIV token and how it works, what are "public goods" projects, how are donors and projects matched, and that the donations function is only the starting point of a grander vision for Giveth.

## This Is the Transcription of the Interview

Donald McIntyre (DM): Hi, I'm Donald McIntyre senior editor at the ETC Cooperative. Today we're going to talk about the ETC Grants Program, one of the winners, which is Giveth, and we're going to talk to Griff Green, the founder of Giveth. Hi Griff, how are you? 

Griff Green (GG): Doing well! How are you, man? 

DM: Very well, thank you! Thank you very much for your time and for being here with us. And, I wanted to ask you a few questions about the project to know more about it, the first one is if you could describe the team.

GG: Sure! Yeah, so Giveth is a very culturally diverse team. We are all over the place, all over the world, from the west coast of Canada to the Philippines, and everywhere in between. We have a large dev team, probably around 10 developers, and but, you know, Giveth is kind of intermixed with another project called General Magic. They're more of a for-profit consulting team, and so there's a little bit of a mix, sometimes, like, most of our design team actually works for General Magic and they kind of come in to do design work and, actually some of our devs, when there's not a lot of Giveth work, actually go and contract out with General Magic. So, if you combine both of those teams we're around 50 people. But, you know, some of the people some of the times are working for Giveth and some of, and other times they're working for a lot of other projects. 

DM: So, at any given time the 50 people can be working on the nonprofit side or the profit side. 

GG: Exactly. This is to survive bear market, because that's what we got to do. 

DM: That's good, yeah, this one has been a long one!

GG: Yeah! yeah um 

DM: The second question is if you could describe the project itself Giveth, what is Giveth?

GG: Yeah. So, Giveth is focused on really bringing in the nonprofit space and the nonprofit ethos into the crypto scene, right? The people who are on the ground right now making change. For me, crypto is about building something better than governments, and it might surprise people, the direction that we're taking, but I don't think it should be a surprise because if you really think about it, when governments fail to provide value to society, people start nonprofits. When people demand some kind of, when the government isn't providing clean water, clean water nonprofits crop up in Venezuela, for instance, so nonprofits are the seed of the revolution, the seed of the evolution for a better society that doesn't focus on government. So, Giveth is trying to be this bridge for the people in the nonprofit space today to connect with the web 3 world to build this these bridges to really make progress toward this the stream of having sort of like a free market replacement for governments using web3 tech. 

DM: So, I checked out the Giveth, and I think that the two main participants, correct me if I'm wrong, are the donors on one side and the projects on the other, no? 

GG: Yeah, so giveth as an application today so there's Giveth as a movement which is what I kind of described before, and then there's the actual application that we're moving to Ether Classic. It's a donation application like GoFundMe or Indiegogo, or Kickstarter and, yes exactly, any project can come into Giveth, create a project and get it listed and if they're creating in public goods, like value for society at large, then they can become verified and get give backs. So, the cool thing is when donors donate to a project on Giveth, 100% of the donation goes to the nonprofit, but at the, we kind of do, kind of like, donation mining so when someone donates, we actually give them GIV tokens for donating as long as it's to a public goods project, a verified public goods project. And, so the donors get receive GIV tokens the project gets all of the donation and if the project uses a referral address, like a referral key they actually can get a portion of the givebacks. We have lots of cool Web3 features that Indiegogo could never do, you know, we don't take cuts from the donations, we have quadratic funding, we have referral links that share the donate, GIV token rewards, based off of to people getting referrals, and we have all sorts of other cool features that really are only available because we created an economy around our platform with the GIV token 

DM: Yeah. And, also something that Kickstarter and those wouldn't be able to do is to make them permissionless, no? 

GG: Exactly, exactly. I mean, we have projects from Iran, we have projects from anywhere in the world that are on our platform, we do not discriminate. We do have a listing process, so when someone creates a project they get a link and they can send that link anywhere. So, because it is our front end and our website, we don't want, like, you know, violent projects for instance that are, like, saying let's bomb Israel or something right now, right? So, we have our own guidelines that we do enforce that are more akin to, like, you know, don't promote violence don't use profanity, you know, these kinds of things, but we don't care who you are where you're from or as long as you're providing value to society your project will make it to our front end and people can donate to it from all around the world. We don't take any custody of any funds, okay, it's just a direct "send".

DM: It happens on the on the blockchain. On the smart contract.

GG: Yeah, there's not even smart contracts, actually. So, when you create a project on Giveth, you just put in your address. It can be your personal key. And when someone donates to you they send it to you. So, it's a direct transfer. We have pure, we used to do it with smart contracts, honestly, and was just more complicated for everyone. So, we try to make it as frictionless as possible. You just bring your own address, one account abstraction and other cool user experience arise, maybe we'll move more towards smart contracts, but, you know, we've been around since 2016 and we've been doing this for a long time trying to make it easy for nonprofits and donors alike, and even just that extra "Approved" button that you have to use to make a transfer of a token to a project, like, why? You know, so we removed all of that and we just go straight peer-to-peer donations. 

DM: So, the part that touches the blockchain, Giveth today is on Ethereum, no?

GG: We're on Ethereum and we're on Optimism and Polygon and Gnosis chain.

DM: So, now the people go to your web app and you have the project, you have the donor, and when there, when there is a match and they send money, that's the only time that it touches the blockchain, which is the transaction to move funds from the donor to them. 

GG: And then we reward them with GIV tokens, but that's something we do post-processing, like, we look at all the donations for the last two weeks and we match those donations with "GIV back rewards".

DM: The GIV token, G-I-V is the symbol. The GIV token is an ERC-20 token? 

GG: Yes. 

DM: Okay, so that also is on the blockchain.

GG: Yep. So, that's on Ethereum and Gnosis chain and Optimism and we're bringing it to ETC. We're very excited to bring it to Ether Classic. 

DM: So, now Giveth is going to be in those blockchains that you mentioned and also in ETC, and this is, this was the purpose of getting the grant.

GG: Yes. We're, we're very excited to try to bring more of a donation culture to Ethereum Classic. 

DM: That's amazing. This brings me, this brings me to a question which is, and we're going to talk about these things later, no? This competition between proof of stake and proof of work and then Ethereum and ETC, which were one before and now separated, but now the only isolated question that I have is that is this the first time that you're going to implement Giveth on a proof of work blockchain. 

GG: Let's see, I mean Giveth was on Ethereum when it was proof of work. So, I wouldn't say that, let me think

um because Optimism is a rollup, Solo, Solo I believe is like a delegated proof of stake as well so I guess it will be, it will be the only proof of work blockchain. yeah.

DM: That's interesting. So, you didn't have issues with the proof of work/proof of stake debate whether one is good, the other is bad, or or things like that? 

GG: No. I mean, I've always been more of a fan of, I mean they both have their merits, they both have their merits, and I'm not one that's like "oh my God we're spending too much electricity". I feel like markets will settle themselves out, honestly, and that we should trust markets to manage these things. I, you know, I'm more of a fan of Ethereum. I think the proof of stake strategy makes sense for Ethereum. I think the proof of work strategy makes sense for Ether Classic.

DM: That's very interesting. I think there's two things, that you, that you said that are very interesting. One is that you started with smart contracts, the whole back end, and now you, you reduced that and you just use the blockchain for its most fundamental value, no? Which is the treasury and the movements. And the other thing is that you are working both on proof of stake and proof of work blockchains and that you are agnostic in that sense. That's that's very very very interesting. The only, the only other question that I had about the project itself is if the projects proposed have to be public goods and what is the definition of a "public good" so people can know and, and go and post them.

GG: No. Anyone can post a project on Giveth and get a link and send funds to people and even if you just have a business idea, that you're trying to make money off of and want to use Giveth to fundraise for that, sure, go ahead and you'll even be searchable and everything, but what we're really focused on, and what our goal is to support projects that are providing public goods. Public goods are the things that governments and nonprofits generally strive to provide. These are things like roads or taking care of the homeless, taking care of the environment. These things do not have great business models because they don't have customers. Public goods, the academic definition of a public good is something that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable, blah, blah, blah. No one cares. Public goods are good. You know, public goods are things that are good for society good for the public and that don't have business models, right? Because instead of excluding people, you help, you provide this value to everyone when you take care of the homeless, a homeless person, you're not just helping that homeless person, you're also helping the whole neighborhood, who when they walk by the homeless person they're like, you know, distraught a little bit. So, when you take care of the environment, there's no one to charge. These things don't have good business models, but we believe they can have good economic models. And, that's really...the end goal is not donations for Giveth. Donations is a stepping stone to enabling these groups to actually create their own economies and create their own currencies. So while Giveth right now is removing all the smart contracts to make ease of use for non-technical people we actually want to one day make it so that people can launch their own economy on Giveth. Launch their own token and have their own reward mechanisms for people who are providing value to society. 

DM: Okay, good. Bueno, thank you, thank you very much for the explanation. How much did you get from the ETC Grants Program? 

GG: Well, you know, I believe we got $50,000. We haven't gotten it all yet We're doing more of a milestone based approach. We want to, you know, we're running technical hurdles. The graph is something that we rely on. And, so we need to do all the things that we want to do which do include smart contracts. For instance, bring giving people who are holding GIV tokens on Ethereum Classic a way to stake those GIV tokens and actually earn rewards for doing so. We need the graph, so we're, like, still investigating on the technical side exactly how to do that and deploy our own graph node. So, I hope we're going to get the full $50k if we can provide the full work, but we don't want the money if we can't do the work, so. 

DM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. To to clarify, the, you got $50,000 but the conditions of giving, of the transfers, is based on milestones and things like that. So, you're going to go getting the $50,000 according to a program that you propose and as you go delivering you get all the money.

GG: Exactly, and we're, and we're looking at a huge technical hurdle that we're not 100% sure we can solve. I think, I, I hope we can and we're working with people from the graph to do it, but it doesn't all rely on us, unfortunately. 

DM: What is the graph?

GG: It is an indexer, it's like when things happen in smart contracts, the smart contract will send out an event, right? And it will also change balances, and the graph is a middleware that's kind of a piece of infrastructure that a lot of blockchains use, Ethereum based blockchains, to manage listening for events and balance changes and quering those, and then using that information to then update the front end, because going straight from blockchain to, like, the website you know it's really slow and ugly, you know, like, and it's really hard. And, so the graph is middleware that's made specifically for listening to the blockchain for specific events or balance changes and then updating the little numbers on a website. How many tokens you have and stuff like that. 

DM: So, you would need to build a graph to be able to adapt the website also to ETC. 

GG: Exactly, otherwise we'd have to completely rebuild our website and, honestly, we can't do that for the, it's not enough. 

DM: Okay, bueno, I hope you can accomplish that. 

GG: I hope so too and, honestly, I think if we do, it will be a big boom for, because other projects have solved this. I think Hebe Swap has got to be using some kind of solution for this. But it's not very well publicized and if we do solve it we will write a blog post or something. We'll put it out there, put some documentation out there that can help other people who are running into similar issues that we are. 

DM: Don't block explorers solve this because they provide all the information that's happening in the blockchain?

GG: They solve, they solve it for an individual person who wants to find that information out but if you want to build a website that, you know, when you click a button and you stake your tokens then those numbers just, like, very quickly show up, and give a user experience that someone is, like, "oh yeah this is smooth", a block Explorer won't solve that because it takes maybe 30 seconds for a transaction to even show up on a block Explorer and then we would have to query the block explorer to get these APIs out and, you know, how do we pay for these things. These queries with the block explorer that there... It would be nice, block explorers have the infrastructure to do this work, but there is very specialized middleware.

DM: They apply it to a different thing and you need to create your own.

GG: You know, unfortunately users have such expectations! Damn those users in their expectations! You know, like, they want everything to happen so quickly, and smoothly, so we have to, we have to try to live up to it. 

DM: You mentioned this briefly, but the next question is, why did you choose ETC?

GG: Well, I'll be honest, I feel like I'm almost a founder of ETC. You know, I have a, I have some history here. My first project was the DOW and I was part of the white hat group who rescued The DAO. And, helped. yeah, like, I worked, I worked for Slockit during The DAO days and I helped make sure that the hard fork happened so that ETC could exist. I don't think most people would frame it that way and, honestly, I think a lot of the ETC True Believers don't like my stance on this very controversial issue, but I think the the magic of ETC and blockchains in general, is that you cannot use blockchain tech to impose your values on other people. And, that's why ETC exists, because some people believe that the substrate of Ethereum should be immutable and should not have given the money back to DAO token holders, and I tend to be on the other side of that debate, and I think that it's important that we use whatever means possible to hack the hacker and give people the money back that they lost, so. But you know, but what's cool is that it's not a 51% vote that decides these things. It's actually consensus networks, so yeah, social consensus was formed and the people who, like, you know, wanted to give the money back to the hacker, or keep, let the hacker keep the money, and, like live to the ideals of immutability, they have Ethereum Classic, and so, yeah, so I'm very, I'm happy to play both sides of that coin. I think both systems have it's proven, it's it's it's it's just true that both systems have value, right? 

DM: I am also another hybrid, like you because I was in Ethereum since, interacting, since 2014, I met Vitalik in 2013, but, so, I was part of the community and I was against the DAO Hard Fork and really arguing very, very, almost, actively and vehemently, and passionately, again with Vitalik and Vlad, even Bob Summerwill, Etc. Against, against doing the DAO Hard Fork and just, digamos, respecting immutability, but when the split happened, I didn't stay with ETC. I stayed with Ethereum for a year I think. Continuing to argue. At that time, I was, that event changed me in a way that I learned about security, true security, no? On blockchains and security in general. Much more, I became much more aware, for me the blockchain was, wow, decentralized and we can do smart contracts it was all about the innovation and the gadgets, but that event gave me awareness of security. And, and, I also, it changed my mind also about proof of stake. So, I so, I argued with Vlad and Vitalik for one year for them to not push and to [not] continue with the proof of stake, and to keep Ethereum with proof of work, but when I saw that it was futile and that I was going to lose, then I moved to ETC. And, in 2018 I started to work for ETC.

GG: Nice, nice so really it's the proof of work that keeps you like focused on ETC. I would say security, the purpose of, I worked with Nick Szabo in two projects, he's in a way, he's my mentor and all these things about blockchain and Cypherpunk philosophy and all that, and clearly, clearly, they have only one goal which is to minimize the role of trusted third parties and to increase security. So, so that was that was my focus and I believe that proof of work is the only consensus mechanism that really solves the decentralization thing up to, at least, up to 50% fault tolerance. So, that, that was, that's more or less my my philosophy. But, this is, this is very, very interesting. So, I already, we already spoke, then, about your experience with The DAO and why ETC. We were, we were, digamos, you explained ETC and that you are okay with proof of work and proof of stake, that you think that they have different roles and good roles for Ethereum good roles for ETC. My last question is the, G-I-V token, no? So, people, the more activity there is, people are going to go receiving the GIV token, and this includes the donors and the projects. If they are public good projects and they have to be, they, verified by the team, by your team, what's the GIV token good for? What, what does it do, like, what?

GG: If you are, so on the donation platform, you know, there's always this challenge, like, who gets shown first, and so we use GIV tokens for governance. Not only for, we, we use it for the most important and interesting thing, is probably that if you stake your GIV tokens then you can boost projects and move them up on the list. So, it's kind of like a, there's this term called "token curated registry". Basically the projects on Giveth can be sorted and are default sorted by how many GIV tokens have staked behind each project. Is a way to frame. Also, for our own development, we have this thing called "token log" where GIV token holders can decide which issues are prioritized for our development. So,  you know, right now it's like multisig compatibility is the most, is I believe, on top, and so, but because right now you can't really use it with a multisig. They want us to get it "Safe" to work with it. So, that's what we're working on. And so, GIV token holders really run Giveth and on top, and also you can stake your GIV tokens to, for governance and want, and we reward people who are actively staking. So, there is a, an issuance kind of, like, issuance that is going to people who stake and the longer you lock your tokens the more issuance you get. So, it's kind of like a good interest rate and, on top of that, the real goal of Giveth again is not donations this is a stepping stone and what we want to do is we want to allow GIV tokens to be the substrate for the investment opportunities of nonprofits. I believe that we won't succeed at building something better than governments until you can invest in a nonprofit. Sounds kind of crazy, but that's the goal and we're going to use GIV tokens to make that easy. And, it's all integrated into making a nonprofit kind of a hybrid. So, they can request donations and receive investment. And when, so they, when they receive investment, we love bonding curves, bonding curves actually are kind of popular with Friend-Tech, right now, and these Friend-Tech clones, but what we're really excited about using it for, is more for, instead of like Friend-Tech where it's, like, kind of a scammy thing, it's, so, that a nonprofit can actually get investment and create a token that has built-in liquidity, already. It's all always, always liquid token. And, when someone gets a donation, instead of getting, when these projects get donations, instead of the give-backs going to the donor, the give-backs would go into the bonding curve and issue a project token to the donors. So, that their donors, their investors, and their workers, the people who are creating value for the organization, can all have a share in the potential, like, future of this project. And, if the project grows and the price of the token goes up then they all actually financially benefit from building this public good and the GIV token is going to be the the key token of that substrate. So, yeah, so that's the that's the future utility that we're working of towards building. We call it GURVES and there's a great blog post that goes through this, it's called a "[Evolving Nonprofits Into Regen Economies](https://blog.giveth.io/evolving-nonprofits-into-regen-economies-f8282f97f8d3)", yeah, regen economies.

DM: Regional economies.

GG: "Regen" like regenerative.

DM:  Oh, okay, "regenerative". Okay, so the GIV token is a core component of the whole system. 

GG: Yeah, yeah I mean the GIV token is all over our application and it has a lot of power over Giveth, and so when you donate to a public goods project through Giveth you are not only, like, just a donor that, like, oh you're sending somebody money but you're now also a governor of our application, our movement.

DM: And, if people want to go and check out Giveth right now where do, where do they have to go? 

GG: [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/), and actually we're running a quadratic funding round which I can't wait till we can do this on Ether Classic, but we're running a quadratic funding round right now with a $25,000 matching pool, so if this, if this video goes out in the next two weeks that will still be active so you can, you can donate to projects right now and get crazy matching donate $2 and all of a sudden the project will get $20, $30, $40.

DM: Okay, good. So, it's [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/). 

GG: Yep. 

DM: Very good, that's where people can go right now to go and see it. Yes, this is going to, today is Monday, October 9th and this is going to be published tomorrow, Tuesday, October 10th. oh

GG: Perfect! wow! 

DM: All right, so people will have time to do it. Bueno, thank you so much Griff for your time, thank you for explaining everything about Giveth and congratulations for earning the $50,000 that you're going to get as you, as you deliver the milestones. And, this is the first round of the ETC grants program, and I guess that, if it goes well, you can apply in future rounds, etc.

GG: Yeah, well and, and if it goes well anyone who is a big fan of ETC can put their project and raise donations in ETC which is the most exciting part.

DM: Excellent, thank you very much Griff.

GG: Thank you, Donald.

DM: Goodbye!
