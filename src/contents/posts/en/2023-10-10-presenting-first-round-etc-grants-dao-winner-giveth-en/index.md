In our video interview, we spoke with Griff Green, founder of Giveth, about the following topics:

- Giveth team description
- What is the Giveth project?
- Grant amount earned
- Why did they choose Ethereum Classic to do this Giveth implementation?
- Bonus: What was Griff Green's role in 2016 when ETH and ETC split?

Among the highlights of the interview we touched on what is the GIV token and how it works, what are "public goods" projects, how are donors and projects matched, and that the donations function is only the starting point of a grander vision for Giveth.

We invite you to see the Giveth web app [here](https://giveth.io/)!
