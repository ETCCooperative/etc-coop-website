We are pleased to share [ETC Cooperative's Board Package for Q1](https://etccooperative.org/etc-cooperative-q1-2025-en.pdf).

Highlights:

 - **Restructuring:** In the first quarter of 2025, the COOP was still grappling with the effects of a major restructuring process that occurred in the fall of 2024. This transition period was marked by the departure of several key team members, including the Social Media Manager, Senior Editor, and Executive Director. 
 - **Roadmap Research:** The COOP, in collaboration with the Board of Directors, has been actively working to extend and refine its long-term roadmap. This strategic effort is focused on building a clearer vision for the futureâ€”one that aligns with the organization's values while adapting to the evolving needs of the ETC ecosystem and community.
 - **Development and Infrastructure:** During this quarter, the ETC Cooperative focused its development and infrastructure efforts in ensuring the continued stability and reliability of the Ethereum Classic network. Core client maintenance remained a top priority, with attention given to performance monitoring and general upkeep.
 - **Comms and Marketing:** The Communications and Marketing team was reduced to a single member during this period. In the absence of a clear new direction from an Executive Director, the team focused on maintaining core communication channels through resourceful and strategic efforts.
 - **Financials:** Due to significant changes in the organization, we are no longer comparing actual expenditures to a budget or previous years. This is because we are now in maintenance mode and spending has decreased significantly. Currently, spending is focused on wages, infrastructure costs, and overhead & management costs.
