Today I am announcing my departure as the Executive Director of the ETC Cooperative, a role which I have held since January 2019.

Grayscale’s funding of the ETC Cooperative came to a close in 2022 and we were lucky to receive a relative windfall in the 2021 bull-market, with nearly $5M of funding in that year.  The ETC Cooperative bought around $1M of ETC that same year, but we have not been in a sustainable funding situation since that time, with just the hope that a new bull market would extend the runway further.

The crypto markets were brutal between March and August of this year, and the ETC Cooperative's reserves (USD + ETC) were reduced from $4.2M down to $2.25M, a drop of nearly $2M dollars in the course of five months.  Cuts to staffing were made in Q2 and in Q3, and in October I came to the decision that I should be the next to leave and I gave my notice to the board of directors.

Spending was reduced from $147K USD per month down to $99K USD per month, and then further to $72K USD per month heading into 2025.  The combination of much reduced spending in combination with rising ETC prices in Q4 has now given us a probable runway until September 2027 at current market rates.

POW Summit was held at the end of September 2024, flush with the end of Q3, and that was a natural place for the following reductions:

* Michael Parenti, who worked with Bob on POW Summit content
* Emma Todd and other MMH staff who worked on POW Summit
* Angelah Liu (Social Media Manager), and stopping all Chinese communications
* Andrew Dick (Marketing Manager) reduced to part-time

With further cuts planned for mid-November:

* Reduction of core development team from 3 developers to 2 developers, with Isaac Ardis ultimately volunteering to leave
* Donald McIntyre (Senior Editor), though eventually extended until the end of the year

My own departure at the end of this year will leave the ETC Cooperative with the following staffing:

* Alison Alexis (part-time) - Financial Controller and Business Services
* Andrew Dick (part-time) - Marketing Manager
* Chris Ziogas - Core Developer
* López León - Core Developer
