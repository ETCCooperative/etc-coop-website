### This Year's POW Summit Will Be Focusing on Four Themes:

All the talks will be organized in four major categories that are prominent topics in the indsutry and thus the focus of this year's summit.

**Proof of Scale:** Industry veterans and newcomers will discuss competing solutions for technical and economic tradeoffs in the hottest sector of development and capital investment.

**Proof of Utility:** Attendants will learn about the emerging protocols and diverse use cases competing for scarce block space on the base layer and L2s.

**Proof of Sustainability:** Innovative miner strategies will be presented for environmentally sustainable solutions driving the technology forward in the face of hostile governments and regulators.
