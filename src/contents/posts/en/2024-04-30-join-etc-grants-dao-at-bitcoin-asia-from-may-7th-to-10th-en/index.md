### ETC: "The Original Ethereum"

On July 20, 2016, the Ethereum community experienced a significant divergence, where the development team enforced a hard fork to roll back transactions. Since then, the world of Ethereum split into two paths: the Original Ethereum (ETC) and the new forked chain (ETH). ETC is the "Original Ethereum," a defender of the blockchain's immutable spirit.

ETC=BTC+ETH! ETC inherits Bitcoin's PoW consensus mechanism and aligns with Bitcoin's economic model by counteracting inflation with periodic halving. On the EVM level, as the "Original Ethereum," ETC has consistently followed Ethereum's technical roadmap, step by step, without isolated innovation, maintaining full compatibility with ETH.

ETC=POW+EVM! With true decentralization brought by the PoW consensus and compatibility with ETH's EVM, ETC is set to become the real global computer! Meanwhile, through cross-chain bridges and various decentralized applications, ETC can also support and enhance the programmability of "digital gold" Bitcoin, allowing it to serve the modern financial ecosystem better.
