We are happy to announce that the Executive Director of the ETC Cooperative, Bob Summerwill, will be joining the Coop's co-organizers of the [POW Summit](https://powsummit.com/) at the [Litecoin Summit](https://litecoin.net/summit) in Nashville this July 24th to 25th of 2024.

To learn more about the event, and for tickets and other details please visit their website at https://litecoin.net/summit.

Mr. Summerwill will speak about the following topics:

- The benefits of proof of work (POW) for the environment
- How POW is changing communities around the world
- The advantages of POW to blockchains such as Ethereum Classic and Litecoin
- News and updates about the ETC blockchain

The [Bitcoin 2024](https://b.tc/conference/2024) conference will be held the same week, so we encourage blockchain and POW enthusiasts to come to Nashville to meet other likeminded crypto community members.
