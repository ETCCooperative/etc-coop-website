We are pleased to share [ETC Cooperative's Board Package for Q2](https://etccooperative.org/etc-cooperative-q2-2025-en.pdf).

Highlights:

 - **Development and Infrastructure:** During the second quarter, the ETC Cooperative concentrated its development and infrastructure efforts on maintaining the overall stability and reliability of the Ethereum Classic network. Ensuring consistent performance of the core clients continued to be a primary focus, with work carried out on monitoring, maintenance, and incremental improvements.
 - **Comms and Marketing:** As [previously announced](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2025-06-03-staffing-changes-at-the-etc-cooperative-en), our Marketing Manager, Andrew Dick, stepped down from his role at the ETC Cooperative as of June 15 2025. This means the marketing function at the ETC Cooperative has been discontinued as of that date until further notice.
 - **Ecosystem Management:** Donald McIntyre was hired as Ecosystem Relations Manager, but due to differences with ETC Cooperative Board members with regard to
the ETC technological roadmap he resigned from his post.
 - **Financials:** Currently, spending is focused on wages, infrastructure costs, and overhead & management costs. Contract wages for Q2 were for 1 full-time developer, 1 part-time finance/admin staff, and 1 part-time ecosystem relations staff. Costs were slightly reduced in Q2 compared to Q1 due to Chris having been fully phased out
with his role. There were no other material differences.
