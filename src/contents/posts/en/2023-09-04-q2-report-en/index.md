We are pleased to share [ETC Cooperative's Board Package for Q2](https://etccooperative.org/etc-cooperative-q2-2023-en.pdf).

Highlights:

 - **ETC Grants DAO:** The first round of the grants process was announced in January of 2023 and the application period went through the end of April. Round one proposals were all submitted during February, March and April. The reviewing and decision making happened during May and June and the winning proposals were revealed in July and will be covered in the Q3 report.
 - **Development and Infrastructure:** In Q2, we released two updates for the Core-Geth client, versions [1.12.11](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/releases/tag/v1.12.11) and [1.12.12](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/releases/tag/v1.12.12). Both of these releases have also been published to the DAppNode registry. In this period, Diego López León redirected his time 100% to Core Geth. This quarter, we also upgraded Safe to its new frontend. Additionally, we changed its name from "Ethereum Classic multisig" to "Catacomb ETC Wallet".
 - **Comms and Marketing:** In addition to our regular mission to evangelize the ETC blockchain and community through the editorial and social media work, we also continued to carry out many large projects, which included 1) the implementation of the new ETC Coop brand, 2) the launch/build of the ETC Grants DAO project, 3) building of the new ETC Coop website, and 4) the launch of the POW Summit Conference in Prague.
 - **Financials:**  Overall, Q2 2023 and Q2 YTD actual costs were pretty consistent with the budget, other than the allocation of the $250K grant money and money allocated to the POW Summit. As of June 30, 2023, the ETC Cooperative holds 60,880 ETC at an average cost of $17.68. This includes the $250K USD in ETC tokens, that were allocated to the grant program. The Coop will be buying another tranche of ETC in Q3, due to very low ETC prices. Liquid assets at the end of Q2 2023 were $4,298,342.
