We are happy to announce the POW Summit 2024 schedule!

You may see the summit's agenda and speakers here: https://powsummit.com/2024/schedule

### This Year's POW Summit Will Be Focusing on Four Themes:

All the talks will be organized in four major categories that are prominent topics in the indsutry and thus the focus of this year's summit.

**Proof of Scale:** Industry veterans and newcomers will discuss competing solutions for technical and economic tradeoffs in the hottest sector of development and capital investment.

**Proof of Utility:** Attendants will learn about the emerging protocols and diverse use cases competing for scarce block space on the base layer and L2s.

**Proof of Sustainability:** Innovative miner strategies will be presented for environmentally sustainable solutions driving the technology forward in the face of hostile governments and regulators.

**Proof of Human Rights:** We will see how recent prosecutorial and legislative actions in the US and Europe have made the credo "Cypherpunks write code" to secure privacy, fungibility, and autonomy more important than ever.

### See Our Top Speakers:

Among the bravest and the brightest, the following speakers will be featured at the summit.

**Phill Zimmermann:** The creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Cypherpunk pioneer will be talking about civic hygiene, national security, and E2E encryption.

**Charley Lee:** The founder of the Litecoin cryptocurrency will be on a fireside chat with Vlad Costea, founder and editor of the Bitcoin Takeover magazine and podcast, talking about Litecoin, payments, and privacy.

**Jameson Lopp:** The professional Cypherpunk and prominent Bitcoin personality will explain the prevalence of private transaction mining exploring into bitcoin transactions that show up in blocks without first being broadcast throughout the p2p network.

**Daniel Batten:** As a Climatetech investor, author, and advisor to family offices and publicly listed companies, Daniel will talk about why hippies will drive the next bullrun (and nerds will make Bitcoin the world's greenest asset).

And, many more!

### Interesting Panels:

There will be five panels with experts discussing the major themes of the indsutry.

**Proof of sustainability panel:** This panel will explore the intricate relationship between Bitcoin mining and sustainability, addressing the evolving landscape of energy consumption and environmental impact.

**Proof of scale L2 panel:** This panel, led by Janszg of Bitcoin Layers, brings together the top L2 builders in the space to separate the hype from the reality of scaling bitcoin.

**Proof of utility panel:** A discussion of current use cases built on the POW algorithm.

**Proof of human rights and privacy panel:** A discussion on the state of privacy in technology and society.

**Litecoin Foundation panel:** The Litecoin Foundation team will provide an update of the features and benefits of LTC and what is in store for the cryptocurrency in the near future.

We invite you to come to the POW Summit where Bob Summerwill, Executive Director of the ETC Cooperative, Michael Parenti, core contributor at Paralelni Polis and Web3privacy Now, and Alan Austin, Managing Director at the Litecoin Foundation, will welcome you and host this year's event to provide the most compelling and in-depth information that will put you up to date with the latest proof of work technology and ecosystem.
