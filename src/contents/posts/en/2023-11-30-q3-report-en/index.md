We are pleased to share [ETC Cooperative's Board Package for Q3](https://etccooperative.org/etc-cooperative-q3-2023-en.pdf).

Highlights:

 - **ETC Grants DAO:** The first round of the program was announced in this quarter and offered up to $1M USD worth of ETC to successful applicants. In the end, we gave out $594,800 USD to worthy projects. The list of winners and their profiles are described in this report.
 - **POW Summit:** The first annual Proof-of-Work Summit was held in Prague, in Sept 2023 and was a smashing success.  The POW Summit is a large international event built in conjunction with our partners from the Litecoin Foundation. Our teams met twice weekly throughout the year to work through the logistics, marketing, sponsorships, and philosophy for the Summit.
 - **Development and Infrastructure:** At Core-Geth we have merged ethereum/go-ethereum at latest-tagged versions twice: v1.12.0 and v1.12.2, which were not trivial excercises. Hyperledger Besu is still in good shape regarding ETC compatibility and is used mostly for testing purposes. In this quarter we also report on our work on network infrastructure and parternships, maintenance of the Blockscout block explorer, and DappNode package updates. 
 - **Comms and Marketing:** This period witnessed various initiatives aimed at increasing awareness, promoting adoption, and enhancing the overall brand image of Ethereum Classic. In the third quarter, the comms team was very busy with the 2023 featured projects. This included the maintenance and update of the ETC Grants DAO project, the ETC Coop website, the POW Summit website, we executed a campaign for the POW Summit, and executed the campaign for ETC Grants DAO.
 - **Financials:** Overall, Q3 2023 actual costs were right at budget, with the exception of the grants funding, which is due to timing differences and the summit income and expenses, that were not originally budgeted. Q3YTD actual costs and budget were also in line. As of September, 2023, the ETC Coop had 60,800 ETC tokens in its custody account, the market value at September 30, 2023 was $995,296. Liquid assets at the end of Q3 2023 were $3,579,578.
