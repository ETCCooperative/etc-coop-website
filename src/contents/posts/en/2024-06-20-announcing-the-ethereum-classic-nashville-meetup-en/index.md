We are happy to announce that we have partnered with [ETC_Radio](https://x.com/ETC_Radio_) and [POW Summit](https://powsummit.com/) to hold an [ETC meetup in Nashville](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ethereum-classic-community-event-nashville-tickets-907672311317) on July 25 2024, just in time for the Litecoin and Bitcoin conferences.

As many in the ETC community will be attending Bitcoin 2024 and the Litecoin Summit in Nashville, we decided to organize a community meetup in-between those events for networking and to talk about ETC. 

Join us for a fun and informative Ethereum Classic Community Event!
