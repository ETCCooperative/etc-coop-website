We are very happy to announce the first project that has concluded and launched its application which was financed by the first round of the ETC Grants DAO program.

The application is the [Alphaday Ethereum Classic dashboard](https://app.alphaday.com/b/ethereumclassic/) "which is a state-of-the-art dashboard, empowering ETC enthusiasts with in-depth insights and real-time data" according to the Alphaday team.

[Alphaday](https://etcgrants.softr.app/project-details-en?recordId=recFXsxD1gSPBC6ab), who received $3,800 from the ETC Grants DAO, is a blockchain data and analytics firm that produces dashboards for several blockchains. These dashboards contain widgets that aggregate information about the networks they cover.

In the case of ETC, the customizable dashboard has 17 widgets with data that ranges from news; the ETC community blog posts; price charts; social media mentions and posts; the ETC Cooperative's team, contacts, and projects; to the technical documentation for developers.

We invite you to see the new ETC Alphaday dashboard [here](https://app.alphaday.com/b/ethereumclassic/)!
