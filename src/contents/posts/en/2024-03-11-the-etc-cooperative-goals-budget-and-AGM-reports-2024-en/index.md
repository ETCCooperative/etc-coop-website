We are happy to release the ETC Cooperative's Goals and Budget for 2024, and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) resolutions.

* [ETC Cooperative's AGM Resolutions](/xxx)

2023 was a year of stability for the ETC Cooperative, with a strong financial position and a fully-staffed team.  This was in stark contrast to previous years, where we had minimal staff beyond the Executive Director and had weak communications and marketing.

Donald produced a huge number of articles, both to the community website and for the Cooperativeâ€™s own site which was completely revamped.  All our communications are simultaneously released in English and Chinese.

We launched the ETC Grants DAO program, organized the inaugural POW Summit, and coordinated the Spiral hardfork (which activated in February 2024).  Our developers continue to maintain and upgrade the core-geth client as our key development project, together with various other lower priority projects.
Our goals for 2024 are similar to 2023.  We are in a steady state and do not have any urgent issues to address or crises to avert.   There will be another round of grants and another POW Summit event, and we will be working with Bitmain on other initiatives to grow the ETC ecosystem.
