We are happy to release the ETC Cooperative's Goals and Budget for 2024, and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) resolutions.

* [ETC Cooperative's AGM Resolutions](/xxx)

2023 was a year of stability for the ETC Cooperative, with a strong financial position and a fully-staffed team.  This was in stark contrast to previous years, where we had minimal staff beyond the Executive Director and had weak communications and marketing.

Donald produced a huge number of articles, both to the community website and for the Cooperative’s own site which was completely revamped.  All our communications are simultaneously released in English and Chinese.

We launched the ETC Grants DAO program, organized the inaugural POW Summit, and coordinated the Spiral hardfork (which activated in February 2024).  Our developers continue to maintain and upgrade the core-geth client as our key development project, together with various other lower priority projects.
Our goals for 2024 are similar to 2023.  We are in a steady state and do not have any urgent issues to address or crises to avert.   There will be another round of grants and another POW Summit event, and we will be working with Bitmain on other initiatives to grow the ETC ecosystem.

## Grants Program

The ETC Grants DAO program was launched in January 2023, during the first round of the program around $700K USD worth of ETC was allocated to seventeen development teams. The program will continue with a second round of open application grants in the course of 2024. Bitmain continues to be very supportive of Ethereum Classic, and it is likely that the open grants program will be augmented with direct grants and partnerships with Bitmain to maximize the value delivered with these funds.

## POW Summit 2024

The inaugural POW Summit was held in Prague in late September 2023.  This was co-hosted with Litecoin Foundation, and was organized to be back-to-back with Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis (HCPP).  This was the ETC Cooperative’s first conference since October 2019. In 2024, the second POW Summit will be held in Frankfort between September 28 and 29. 

## Development: Enhancing Client Stability and Functionality

The ETC Cooperative’s proposed pathway for ETC for 2024 development is:

- Enhancing client stability and functionality through comprehensive maintenance and enhancement of the Core-Geth client, and advanced support and refinement in cross-client testing (e.g. Core Geth, Erigon, Core Geth Light, Hyperledger Besu).
- Network Observation and Analysis Advancements (network health) tools such as node infrastructure for observation and analysis; upgrading chain and network monitoring and incident reaction systems; upgrading network analysis tooling; and unified infrastructure management (many servers are managed manually, so we will unify adminstration with a single deployment interface called Ansible).
- Technological Development and Exploration where we will explore EVM Object Format (EOF), continue advocacy for inclusion to Ethereum and ETC (the Prague hardfork will potentially include EOF but it is competing with Verkle trees); exploring EIP-1559 enablement for Ethereum compatibility; for Verkle Trees we will research ETC implications in the absence of a beacon chain (the Ethereum Patricia Merkle Tree will be replaved with the new Verkle Tree model that are lighter); we will study privacy-oriented Core-Geth deployment, perhaps add privacy technology to node software such as VPN; and enhancing regression testing and automating release processes (whether new releases affects older releases, etc.).
